				These templates are made with simple structure made of HTML tables. There are no image spacers or other graphic elements that you need to edit if you want to change the structure of templates. To change and manipulate table structure you only need text editor (try to use some free HTML text editor like <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>).<br/><br/>
				Basic structure of templates are made with three primary tables:<br/>
				- First table (<em>main table</em>) is 100% width<br/>
				- Second table (<em>main centred table</em> inside <em>main table</em>) we use to center the template content<br/>
				- Third table (<em>main content table</em> inside <em>main centred table</em>) we use as container for content – this table is made of table rows that hold contents of our template (images, texts and other tables with content)<br/><br/>
				As you can see, the most important table is the third table (<em>main content table</em>) made with table rows. I like to call these table rows <strong><em>modules</em></strong> cause they represent a block of content. All that is needed to change the structure of existing templates, or to make new ones, is to understand how to manipulate and use these table rows (modules). <a href="#modules">Read more about modules and how to use them...</a><br/><br/>
				<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> in case of templates “newsletter-1”, “newsletter-2” and “newsletter-3” certain rows of third table that holds content are divided into two columns, so you'll not be able to insert any existing content module in these table rows, but you can <a href="#columns">read here how to manipulate with content of these columns...</a><br/><br/>
				Inside HTML code of templates and modules you can find comments that will help you to use and edit content and structure of templates. Important elements (table rows and modules) are marked with starting (START module) and closing (END module) comment.</p>

				> Open files “newsletter-5” and “simple-news-3” in text editor.<br/>

				<p><strong>3. How to create you own template using modules (table rows) from existing templates:</strong><br/>
				Assume that you want to create template with content structure completely different from existing templates...<br/>
				> Open file “-BLANK-ribbon” in your text editor. This blank template already has inserted module with header navigation, header and footer. Go to line 66 where is inserted comment <em>--INSERT MODULES HERE--</em> (see picture). This comment is placed between header and footer modules.</p>
				<img src="exampimg/modules-3-1.jpg" />
				<p>> Now you can copy any existing module (table row) from any existing file. <br/>
				For this example I will use three modules from next files: <br/>
				dark gray section header from file 'events-1'- lines: 66 > 79<br/>
				one column image with text from file 'simple-news-1'- lines: 66 > 125<br/>
				three column content from file 'newsletter-4' - lines: 188 > 278<br/>
				> Select and copy above listed modules (comment lines and everything between them) and paste them one after other in “-BLANK-ribbon” file on line 66 where is inserted comment <em>--INSERT MODULES HERE--</em>. If you have used above listed modules like I did your template should look like this:</p>
				<img src="exampimg/modules-3-2.jpg" />
				<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> in same way you can insert horizontal dividers between inserted modules...</p>

				In these template files we have used the third table (main content table) row divided in two columns. We can’t use existing content modules here, but the principle of adding or deleting parts of content is not so different then working with modules.<br/>

So, before you upload everything you’ll need to ad pre-defined <unsubscribe> tag in HTML code of your template if you don’t want to see their ugly “unsubscribe” link at bottom of your e-mail newsletter. How to add unsubscribe tag:<br/>
				> Open your template in text editor... now find text “unsubscribe” that is shown at top of your newsletter... if you used template “newsletter-4” it will be on line 34 together with other links at top of your template (see picture).</p>
				<img src="exampimg/mccm-1-1.jpg" />

				...replace that code with following: <span>&lt;unsubscribe&gt;&lt;span style="color: #93BD3D; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;unsubscribe&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;unsubscribe&gt;</span><br/>
