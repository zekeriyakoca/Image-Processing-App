jQuery.dmenu
================

A small framework for creating a beautiful desktop navigation menu on your website and webapp.

Sorry for the lack of documentation, hopefully coming soon.

### Licence
The jQuery.dmenu plugin is licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Dependencies
+ jQuery 1.7 or higher

### Development
This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to transpile, minify and concatenate the TS/JS and SCSS/CSS files.
If you are unfamiliar with Gulp, check [this tutorial](https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp) on how to get started.<br />
Run `gulp watch` in the command-line to put a watch on the files and run all scripts immediately after saving your changes.
